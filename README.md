# Peertransfer

In-browser secure P2P-filetransfer in *three simple steps:*

1. Select the file you want to send.
2. Open the generated link on other PCs.
3. Download over a **direct (as in peer-to-peer)** and **end-to-end encrypted** line.

*Thus the file will only be available for download as long as the sender keeps his browser tab open.*

- [x] Data is sent peer-to-peer
- [x] Data is transferred using end-to-end encryption (due to WebRTC)
- [x] The initial messages that are relayed by server to initiate the p2p WebRTC connections are encrypted using a key that is shared out-of-band while passing around the generated URL (to protect against IP leakages and man-in-the-middle attacks while initiating WebRTC)

# Install
